Context Summary
SmartGrade, an automated essay-grading system, increased efficiency but raised concerns about:
• Misinterpretation of creative essays (±7% error margin)
• Underperformance on non-standard English (18% bias)
• 61% student dissatisfaction
• A leaked memo showing executives fear transparency may jeopardize contract renewal (60 days away)

Additional emerging issues include: multilingual fairness, pedagogical distortion, vendor lock-in, auditability, and over-reliance on proprietary, opaque AI systems.


Transparency: The model must explain grading criteria, highlight detected issues, and justify proposed grades.
Model Design: Simplify the model to reduce bias and variance; enhance accuracy through larger, diverse training data.
Ethical Concerns:
Risk of bias against linguistic minorities.
Potential academic integrity issues (“teaching to the algorithm”).
Limited contestability of automated grades.
Data consent and provenance uncertainties.
Dependence on proprietary AI may erode student trust.
