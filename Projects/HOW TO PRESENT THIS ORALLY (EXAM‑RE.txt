HOW TO PRESENT THIS ORALLY (EXAM‑READY)

You can structure your explanation like this:

1️⃣ Mathematics

Elliptic curve over finite field

Group law, scalar multiplication

Security rests on ECDLP

2️⃣ Protocol

Key generation: d, Q = dG

Signing: (r, s)

Verification equation

3️⃣ Banking Simulation

Transactions are serialized and signed

Bank verifies before accepting

4️⃣ Security Analysis (MOST IMPORTANT)
Attack	Result
Replay	❌ fails (signature bound to message)
MITM	❌ fails (message tampering detected)
Forgery	❌ infeasible
Malleability	✅ succeeds (ECDSA property)
Weak k	✅ private key recovered

You’ll score very high on analysis quality here.

✅ WHY THIS IS A STRONG PROJECT

✅ Clean crypto separation
✅ Interactive demonstration
✅ Attacks are explained, not just shown
✅ Matches exactly what the brief demands
✅ Publishable as a teaching demo
